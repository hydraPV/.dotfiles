# Dotfiles


This is my daily driver **Hyprland** environment. Mainly used for gaming and doing and testing/learning things about Linux.

As i said before, there is probably a high amount of absurd things in this repository, i am still learning a lot of things.
This repository itself, has been my way to learn about git and has been amazing.

> This is my second repository, i have another one with my old **bspwm** / First Hyprland [Dotfiles](https://github.com/hydraPV/.dotfiles-old).
